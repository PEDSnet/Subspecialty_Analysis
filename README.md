# Subspecialty_Analysis
## Purpose

###	Primary objective
Determine the proportion of study eligible children between the ages of 0 and 20 who used pediatric subspeciality care at least once in a given calendar year between 2010 and 2021 in any care setting (i.e., in an inpatient hospital, outpatient, emergency department, or community-based practice care setting), stratified by age group and sex.  

###	Secondary objective
For each pediatric subspecialty, determine the most common diagnoses among patients based on the number encounters in the outpatient or community-based practice care setting from 2010 to 2021.  

## Structure
following the PEDSnet "standard framework" structure, the code is divided into various folders including:
* Code: contains the files that create local database tables from the larger PEDSnet database
* Specs: contains the CSV files that define codes used to search for relevant terms such as provider and care site specialties
* Site: used to customize the standard framework implementation for a specific project
*
